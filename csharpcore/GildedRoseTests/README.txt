The test strategy was to first implement basic tests that cover the degradation and quality of basic items. 
After that we tackled special items like the Aged Brie and Sulfuras which had unique mechanics to them. 
The last step was to include tests for the backstage pass, which had quite a few distinctive elements to it. 

Our biggest challenge was that items needed their full names (example given: backstage pass = Backstage passes to a TAFKAL80ETC concert) 
for them to be handled correctly.
